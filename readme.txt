A Wordpress plugin and widget that lets you accept bitcoin on your site!

== Description ==
A Wordpress plugin and widget that lets you accept bitcoin on your site! Use the `[coinbase_button]` shortcode along with the parameters on [this page](https://coinbase.com/api/doc/1.0/buttons/create.html). Example:

`[coinbase_button name="Socks" price_string="10.00" price_currency_iso="CAD"]`

A menu widget is also included.

== Installation ==

0. Generate an API key with the 'user' and 'merchant' permissions at https://coinbase.com/settings/api. For security reasons, please do not grant any other permissions to this key. If you don't have a Coinbase account, sign up at https://coinbase.com/merchants. Coinbase offers daily payouts for merchants in the United States. For more infomation on setting up payouts, see https://coinbase.com/docs/merchant_tools/payouts.

1. Visit your admin section and click Plugins -> Add New.  Then search for "Coinbase".

2. Once you’ve installed the plugin, visit the Settings -> Coinbase page and enter the credentials obtained in step 0.

3. Now that the widget is enabled you can add a bitcoin payment button anywhere on your blog using one of two methods:

* a "short code" that looks like this:

`[coinbase_button name="Alpaca Socks" price_string="10.00" price_currency_iso="CAD"]`

You can add any customizable values as described in our documentation.  This works on any page or location of your site.

* using the WordPress "widget" which will appear in the right sidebar of your app.

== Screenshots ==
